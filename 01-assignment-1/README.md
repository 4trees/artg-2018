# Review of npm and git

Both Git/github and npm are tools we'll use extensively throughout the class. We'll have many opportunities to practice with their use, and this brief assignment will get you up to speed.

## Installation
Please install the latest versions of the following on your computer
* Node.js
* npm
* Git

Please also sign up for a Github account if you don't already have one.

## Basic workflow: cloning the code base for this class
Make sure you have the required software installed and log into Github. Navigate to to the course repo, and click on the "fork" button.
